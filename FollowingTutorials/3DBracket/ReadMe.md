# 3D Bracket Tutorial Practice
First attempt at 3D modeling, followed a tutorial by SourceCAD - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSRn0maJRfg
Learned a lot about 3D modeling from the tutorial, especially how working with 2D lines in a 3D space will lead to accidentally having the Z direction play into your lines when you don't intend for it to. All in all a useful tutorial to start me off in 3D modeling.
