Followed SourceCAD's tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsSexwfuuTc. I was not a fan on the lack of consistency for the positioning details. I greatly appreciate the exact instructions and when met with "get the rectangle around the middle" without specific unit based referencing it was quite annoying.
