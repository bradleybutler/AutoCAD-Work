# AutoCAD-Work
### Designs in AutoCAD design software
I am currently working to become more profficient in my use of AutoCAD and other CAD softwares. The best way for this is practice, and so all my work from self designed models to publically available practice problems are included to show my current level of CAD ability. I view myself as intermediate in the 2D drafting workspace and developing in the 3D modeling workspace
#### Following Tutorial File
In this file are works where I closely followed a tutorial. The ReadMe will include where I got the tutorial from
#### Public Practice File
In this file are works where I found a public design, usually made for practice, and used the design and it's measurement annotations to copy the design into AutoCAD. These public designs have been very helpful for learning the program, and I believe show profficiency in being able to take a design and bring it into a CAD software through various tools. ReadMe's will include where the design was sourced from, and the folder will contain a PDF of the initial design
#### Selfmade Designs
These are self made designs. If there was any inspiration it will be mentioned and linked in the ReadMe. If applicable, all hand drawings or other conceptual design before the CAD model will be included, as well as a more detailed ReadMe on the process and purpose of the design
